Provides examples for running different HPO workflows.

Edits:

. Point Supervisor to your CANDLE-compliant DNN: +
  Edit mlrmbo/test/test-1.sh:
.. Set MODEL_PYTHON_SCRIPT to cc_t29res +
   This is just the name of your Python script
.. Set MODEL_PYTHON_DIR to $HOME/.../1_migrating_your_DNN_to_candle +
   This is inserted into PYTHONPATH so that your Python script can be found
. Set up your search space: +
  Edit mlrmbo/test/cfg-prm-1.sh:
.. Set PARAM_SET_FILE to $EMEWS_PROJECT_ROOT/data/nt3_hps_exp_01.R
.. You can edit nt3_hps_exp_01.R
. Set your data location: +
  Edit 1_migrating_your_DNN_to_candle/t29_default_model.txt for Theta:
