Provides examples for running the upf workflow. The examples
illustrate both high throughput inferencing and uncertianty
quantification.

Make sure that Benchmarks/common is set (outside of CANDLE)
Make sure that the data is available
Make sure that the path to the data is fully specified

We will demonstrate the use of the dropout layer at inference time.
First, we must use the PermanentDropout class from the CANDLE library.

1. set MODEL_NAME in upf-1.sh
2. set BENCHMARK_DIR in cfg-sys-1.sh
3. set MODEL_PYTHON_SCRIPT in cfg-sys-1.sh
4. set PROCS, QUEUE, WALLTIME in cfg-sys-1.sh

Need to modify the DNN infer to use PermenantDropout
 to have a parameterized output file.
 to hava a paramterized input file.
 to use PermenantDropout


So If I understand this correctly, all I have to do in my DNN is replace the Dropout layer with a PermanentDropout layer from keras_candle?

Yes, youâ€™d need to call the register function only in the code that needs to load the network from checkpoint.
