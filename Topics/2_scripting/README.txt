An overview of how to write a DNN in keras that can be used in CANDLE.
Preseented by Tom Brettin.

In the first 10 minutes I'll review the CANDLE Benchmarks. These were the first DNNs used in CANDLE
  Cancer problems
  Programming language and library choices
  Setting up an environment
  Github site organization
  
In the next 10 minutes we will use one of the benchmarks as an illustrative example of how to implement a DNN so that it will run in the CANDLE framework. In particular, we will look at NT3. 

In the last 10 minutes, I'll demonstrate running the NT3 benchmark on one or more of the DOE systems. I'll discuss the DOE system specific configurations.
